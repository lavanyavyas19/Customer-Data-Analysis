# Customer Data Analysis Project

This project focuses on building and querying a **Customer Database Management System (DBMS)** using **MySQL**. The objective is to manage customer data, orders, and agents through a well-structured relational database and to derive insights using SQL queries and Python data analysis.

The project includes:
- **SQL scripts** for database design and querying.
- **CSV files** containing raw customer, agent, and order data.
- **Jupyter Notebook** for visual analysis and generating reports.
- A **problem statement document** that outlines the objectives and scope of the project.

## üìÇ Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains raw data CSVs:
  - `Customer.csv`: Contains customer details.
  - `Agents.csv`: Contains information about customer agents.
  - `orders.csv`: Contains details of customer orders.
  
- `sql/`: SQL script for database creation and data loading:
  - `customer_data_analysis.sql`: SQL file for creating tables, relationships, and inserting data.

- `notebook/`: Jupyter Notebook with analysis and graphs:
  - `imarticus1.ipynb`: Contains the data analysis and visualizations.

- `docs/`: Project documents and problem statement:
  - `Problem Statement - Customer DB Mgmt.docx`: Outlines the goals, objectives, and scope of the database management system.

## üìù Problem Statement

The project aims to design and implement a Customer Database Management System using **MySQL** to manage data related to customers, agents, and orders. The goals include:
- Designing an efficient database structure using **relational database principles**.
- Writing SQL queries to generate reports and insights from the data.
- Analyzing data using Python and Jupyter Notebook for visualizations and business insights.

**Key objectives** include:
- Creating the database and defining tables, relationships, and keys for data integrity.
- Loading data into the database from the provided CSV files.
- Writing SQL queries to generate insights about customer behaviors, agent performance, and order tracking.

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

- **MySQL**: To create the database and execute SQL queries.
- **Python** (with libraries such as **pandas**, **matplotlib**, and **seaborn**): For data analysis and visualization in Jupyter Notebooks.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: To run and visualize the analysis in Python.

## üìä Expected Outcomes

By the end of this project, the following outcomes are expected:

1. **Understanding Relational Database Design**:
   - Learn to design and implement a **relational database** using **MySQL**.
   - Understand how to define **primary keys**, **foreign keys**, and **relationships** between tables for data integrity.

2. **Hands-On Experience with SQL**:
   - Write **SQL DDL (Data Definition Language)** and **DML (Data Manipulation Language)** queries for creating tables, inserting data, and querying for insights.
   - Gain experience with **complex SQL queries** to generate reports and analyze customer and order data.

3. **Data Analysis and Reporting**:
   - Use **Jupyter Notebook** for exploratory data analysis and visualizing patterns in the customer, order, and agent data.
   - Generate reports to track **sales performance**, **customer behavior**, and **agent performance** using data insights.

4. **Building a Complete Solution**:
   - From database design to data analysis and reporting, gain experience in handling the **end-to-end** process of building and analyzing a database system for a business.

5. **Business Intelligence Skills**:
   - Develop skills in **data-driven decision-making**, leveraging the insights derived from the database to improve operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.
   - Explore how **SQL queries** can provide actionable business insights for improving sales and agent performance.

## üìÑ Problem-Solving Scope

The **Customer Database Management System (DBMS)** addresses several business needs:
- Efficient management of **customer data**.
- Tracking **orders** and associating them with the right **customer** and **agent**.
- **Optimizing agent assignments** and analyzing **sales performance**.
- Ensuring **data integrity** through relational tables and keys.

## üå± Next Steps

Future improvements could include:
- Integrating **automated reporting tools** for real-time insights.
- Using **machine learning models** to predict customer behavior and sales trends.
- Expanding the database to include more granular data, such as customer preferences or feedback.
